The goal of this thesis work was to exploit the real-time accessibility of the hits from a complex detector at LHC such as the VELO in order to defined statistics to use for real-time monitoring purposes. The hits were reconstructed using a clustering firmware that  It was shown that using very much limited information on the VELO
