In Run 3, LHCb introduces an innovative trigger system, marking the first time that all collision events at the LHC undergo a real-time and offline-level quality reconstruction, operating at an average frequency of 30 MHz. This decision arises from the need for detailed and flexible trigger selections crucial for the physics events targeted by LHCb. However, reconstructing events at this frequency, especially tracks, poses a significant computational challenge. To address this, LHCb adopts a heterogeneous computing system. In this setup, the initial trigger level (HLT1) relies entirely on an array of GPUs, leaving CPU resources for the subsequent level (HLT2), where thorough event reconstructions occur at a reduced rate compared to HLT1. Additionally, heterogeneous computing solutions are employed for lower-level tasks, with ongoing research and development activities aimed at preparing for future LHCb runs, where the collaboration plans to increase the operational luminosity by another order of magnitude compared to Run 3.\\
