I wish to thank both Professor Punzi and Professor Graverini for their prompt review of this thesis. The assistance of Federico Lazzari was also greatly appreciated, particularly for his review of Chapter 3 and Chapter 2. I am especially grateful to Daniele Passaro, who supported me from the very beginning to the very end of this thesis. Much of the work discussed here builds on his preceding thesis, which provided a solid foundation for this kind of development. I also extend my thanks to all the other members of the LHCb Pisa group who offered help answering all the questions I ever had in this year of work. 
Furthermore, I wish to thank also all the people in the luminosity and RTA working groups. They provided an important feedback on the tools discussed in this thesis.
