Moore’s Law has been an important benchmark for developments in microelectronics and information processing for over three decades. During this time, its applications and interpretations have proliferated and expanded, often far beyond the validity of the original assumptions made by Moore. Technical considerations of optimal chip manufacturing costs have been expanded to processor performance, economics of computing, and social development. It is therefore useful to review the various interpretations of Moore’s Law and empirical evidence that could support them. Such an analysis reveals that semiconductor technology has evolved during the last four decades under very special economic conditions. In particular, the rapid development of microelectronics implies that economic and social demand has played a limited role in this industry. Contrary to popular claims, it appears that the common versions of Moore’s Law have not been valid during the last decades. As semiconductors are becoming important in economy and society, Moore’s Law is now becoming an increasingly misleading predictor of future developments.

Within the upgraded DAQ system, LHCb established a testbed for new heterogeneous computing solutions for real-time event reconstruction, in view of future runs at even higher luminosities. One such solution is a highly-parallelized custom tracking processor (“Artificial Retina”), implemented in state of the art FPGA devices connected by fast serial links. We describe the status of a realistic prototype for the reconstruction of pixel tracking detectors that will run on real data during run-3.}

We demonstrate that this expression facilitates the use of a Kalman filter track model in a minimum χ2 algorithm for the alignment of tracking detectors. We also show that it allows to incorporate vertex constraints in such a procedure without refitting the tracks.}
